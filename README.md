### Caverns of Czernobog
Like a game from 1982, but with worse graphics and tragically less gameplay.

I mostly did this as an excuse to prepare for an ominously vague CSSE2002 exam.

### How to run
I did this in IntelliJ, because I'm not sure how to run Gradle.
Basically, get everything compiled, then run 'java CavernsOfCzernobog'.

Have noticed a potential issue running on CMD or PowerShell, and not IntelliJ terminal.
The ASCII art formatting gets a bit... wierd.
