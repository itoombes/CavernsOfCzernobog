Basically, want to make a simple Dungeons of Daggorath-like game

Will be entirely terminal-based, as I have no flipping clue how to make a GUI in Java.


### Potential gameplay ideas
Turns --> Can take a number of turns in an encounter
Can :

[A]ttack --> Press A1, A2, A3 to use weapon in that slot

Cast [S]pell --> Press S1, S2, S3 to use spell in that slot

[D]efend --> Press D. Will reduce damage by half, but expends turn

[F]lee --> Generally a last resort. Leave the encounter, with no chance of victory

------------------

[I]nventory --> Open inventory interface

[P]layer --> Open player interface

[N]othing --> End turn, without doing anything
